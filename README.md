# Psychic-Game

Press any key to guess the letter chosen by the computer
If you guess the correct letter your wins increase by one and the game starts again
If you do not guess the computer's letter within 9 tries you lose, and your losses increase by one and the game resets.

Issues to fix: If the user accidentally hits the same key more than once the double hit still counts as a guess and registers in the user guesses more than once.
